<p>Coming to Javascript from other languages such as Python and Golang, I was a bit overwhelmed by the bad press it was getting, both from its well known gotchas and from the amount of ever-changing frameworks in existence.</p>

<p>I started out learning <em>vanilla</em> JS and JQuery from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a> and the <a target="https://amzn.to/2FYWK4P" target="_blank">Eloquent Javascript</a> book (<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s the online version of it</a>), which gave me a fair understanding of the language but a somewhat shaky foundation.</p>

<p>I then began to take a look at what I&rsquo;d call the 3 big frameworks a few google searches revealed to me: Angular, React and Vue.</p>

<h2 id="angular">Angular</h2>

<p>I had already heard about Angular from a few years before from an old classmate.</p>

<p>I vividly remembered him telling me about how complex it was but the promises of Angular 2 and the use of Typescript had me going through the tutorial in no time.</p>

<p>Angular seemed quite verbose but quite logical and I decided to roll with it and got myself <a href="https://amzn.to/2S6p0ss" target="blank">Angular in Action</a>, which goes further than the tutorial, with a good balance between explanations, examples and best practices.</p>

<p>Well armed with the knowledge of this book, I decided to use Angular for a few unsupervised toy projects and I quickly came to the realization that using Angular beyond any simple use seemed to require a very thought out design that I was somewhat still unable to come up with given my inexperience.</p>

<p>Not wanting yet to sink a considerable amount of time trialing, I decided to take a look at the other frameworks I listed on top of this post.</p>

<h2 id="react">React</h2>

<p>React was sort of the natural next choice. It seemed to be the cool kid around that every startup was using.</p>

<p>Following the same process as Angular, I toured the tutorial and made a few simple pet projects in order to understand it.</p>

<p>I came to grow fond of the component based design but JSX ended up being a deal breaker for me as I just plainly disliked it.</p>

<p>I also tried using Typescript while developing in React which turned out to be a big mistake and the source of endless frustrations until I just dropped it and went back to plain old JS.</p>

<h2 id="vue">Vue</h2>

<p>I then checked out Vue, which, after a short tour of the homepage, seemed very similar to React.</p>

<p>I half reluctantly went through the docs which got my interest going and, as before, tried out a few simple projects which actually got me quite hooked.</p>

<p>It seemed to solve so easily most of my issues with both Angular AND React: most of the rookie mistakes I made while coding using Vue were actually solved by taking some time to think and going through the docs.</p>

<p>In order to get a few pointers and kickstart my use of the framework, I used <a href="https://amzn.to/2RNEcvv" target="blank">this book</a>. It has its issues but the code is freely available on github and has the added benefit of guiding a new user (like I was) into firebase.</p>

<h2 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h2>

<p>Thanks to its simplicity and efficiency, I am only using Vue for everything in the browser.</p>

<p>After going through the initial learning pains and beginner mistakes for a few days at most, I feel like Vue just works. I can just easily play around with my code and it feels fast and simple.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s what matters to me.</p>
