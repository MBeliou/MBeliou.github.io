      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize over the last year that people get quite curious about cryptocurrency mining and have had several people coming to me ask about how it works and if running a mining operation is feasible.

      <description>Bitcoin is a volatile asset that has grown exponentially ever since its inception in 2009. Being essentially unregulated, it has found immense popularity with people mostly unprepared to deal with both its 2017&amp;rsquo;s quick rise and 2018&amp;rsquo;s disastrous fall.
This post is meant to explain what options are and how they can be used to protect your value and lock-in profits without giving up on a possible upside.</description>
