<p>Bitcoin is a volatile asset that has grown exponentially ever since its inception in 2009. Being essentially unregulated, it has found immense popularity with people mostly unprepared to deal with both its 2017&rsquo;s quick rise and 2018&rsquo;s <strong>disastrous</strong> fall.</p>

<p>This post is meant to explain what options are and how they can be used to protect your value and lock-in profits without giving up on a possible upside.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-an-option">What is an option?</h1>

<p>An option is a financial contract that enables you to make a <strong>choice</strong> regarding an asset, hence giving you an &ldquo;option&rdquo;. Options come in two different forms: <strong>call</strong> and <strong>put</strong>, which are related respectively to buying and selling.</p>

<p>The idea behind an option is really simple and better understood through an example:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go the past for a bit, in December 2017 to be precise.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is all the rage and trading at 17,000$ due to a sharp upward movement.</p>

<p>You believe Bitcoin is here to stay, that it has a way to go but you wish you could lock in some profits in case things go wrong.</p>

<p>To do so, you go to a reliable exchange listing Bitcoin options (such as Deribit) and buy <strong>one put</strong> with a strike price of 17,500$ and an expiration date of June 2018.</p>

<p>In layman terms, this means we have just bought the possibility to sell <strong>one full bitcoin</strong> at a 17,500$ value in June 2018. When the day comes, we can <strong><em>choose</em></strong> to exert or not this put.</p>

<p>Looking at current options prices and Bitcoin historical values, buying such a put would have cost around a <strong>1,000$</strong> and protecting us from a loss of <strong>11,000$.</strong></p>

<p>Here is a simple payout graph for this option.</p>

<p><img src="/img/put_value.png" alt="Payout" /></p>

<p>As we can see, the only loss that a trader buying such a put can suffer is the price of the option. Any price move lower than 16,000$ ends up in a benefit for the option holder.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-choose-an-option">How to choose an option</h1>

<p>As a trader looking to protect his portfolio, you will mostly be <strong>buying</strong> options.</p>

<p>Why? Because only the buying side gets to choose. The selling side takes all the risk for itself by promising to buy/sell the asset at the given strike price.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-option">Choosing the Option</h2>

<h3 id="option-type">Option type</h3>

<p>As said above, there are two types of options: <strong>calls</strong> and <strong>puts</strong>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen already the use of a put as a way to lock in a sell price and profits.</p>

<p><strong>Calls</strong> are the opposite of puts: they enable you to have the choice to <strong>buy</strong> the asset at a given price. Just as puts are used to ensure access to an interesting sell price, **calls **give the opportunity to &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo; without risking all your capital.</p>

<p>Simply said: <strong>calls</strong> go with an upward movement, <strong>puts</strong> go with a downward movement.</p>

<h3 id="strike-price-and-expiration">Strike price and expiration</h3>

<p>The strike price is the price at which the option will be locked. In our example, we locked a bitcoin price at 17,500$ because it seemed (rightfully so) like a good price.</p>

<p>If we were confident in a continued upward movement, we could have chosen to instead buy <strong>calls</strong> at 17,500$, hence locking a future buy price lower than the market price.</p>

<p>The expiration date is quite simply the lifetime of the option. A normal option can only be exercised then although it can be freely traded until then.</p>

<p>Both of these variables have an impact on the option&rsquo;s price. The value of an option is a reflection of both the difference in price between the strike and the asset as well as the volatility of the asset itself (Which makes sense since the <strong><em>aim</em></strong> of an option is to protect from volatility).</p>

<p>Since a longer period of time means more time for the volatility to affect the asset price, options with an expiration date that is further in the future are more expansive.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, a <strong>call</strong> with a strike price <strong>under</strong> the asset price will be valued at :</p>

<p>$$
CallPrice = assetPrice_{current} - strikePrice + volatilityPrice
$$</p>

<p>Same for a <strong>put</strong>:
$$
PutPrice = strikePrice - assetPrice_{current} + volatilityPrice
$$
Keep in mind that these equations are voluntarily simplified for easier and quick math. Complete books have been written on the subject of option valuation.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Options are an inexpensive way to both limit <strong>and</strong> increase exposure to an asset. Even simply buying one option can as we&rsquo;ve seen protect you from a adverse market movement without having to put in too much capital.</p>

<p>The low capital needed to put in trade also means that options can be used for completely speculative trades, somewhat likening leverage.</p>

<p>Multiple options can also be combined to deal efficiently with the market&rsquo;s expected evolution, check out Collar options or Bull / Bear put spread for some ideas.</p>
